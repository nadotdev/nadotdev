ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m a Software Dev who loves building fast, reliable apps.

**ðŸ”­ Right now Iâ€™m working on:**
- **Ride-hailing app**  
  Connecting drivers and riders instantly with real-time maps and notifications.
- **Scalable microservices**  
  Breaking features into small, self-contained services that grow on demand.
- **Secure, high-speed APIs**  
  Keeping data safe with JWT logins and making everything load in a flash.
- **AI-powered tools**  
  Smartly matching drivers to riders and spotting trends for better service.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if youâ€™d like to collaborate!
