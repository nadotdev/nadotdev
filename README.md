# 🚀 Welcome to My GitHub

I'm a passionate **Backend Engineer** building scalable, real-time applications with a focus on performance, clean architecture, and efficient data handling. Here's a glimpse into what I'm currently working on:

---

### 🔭 What I'm Working On

- 🚖 **Ride-Hailing Platform**  
  Building a next-gen ride-hailing app using **Flutter** (frontend), **Django** (backend), **Redis** (real-time location), and **WebSockets** (live updates).  
  - **Real-time Driver-User Matching**: Low-latency matching using Redis Geo and Pub/Sub.  
  - **Live Trip Updates**: WebSockets for real-time location tracking and notifications.  
  - **Clean Architecture**: Decoupled layers for maintainability and testability.  

- 🧱 **Scalable Microservices Architecture**  
  Developing a mono-repo backend with isolated, horizontally scalable services.  
  - **Microservices**: Booking, Trip, Notification, and Location services.  
  - **Redis-Driven Real-Time Processing**: Geo queries, sorted sets, and streams for precise location management.  
  - **API Gateway and Load Balancing**: Efficient routing with Dockerized services.  

- 🔐 **Production-Ready APIs**  
  Crafting secure, high-performance APIs with **JWT authentication** and **Redis caching** for real-time experiences.  
  - **JWT for Secure Sessions**: Role-based access for drivers and passengers.  
  - **Optimized Caching**: Redis for low-latency data retrieval and ETag support.  
  - **Scalable WebSocket Messaging**: Real-time event broadcasting with Redis Streams.  

- 🤖 **AI-Enhanced Productivity**  
  Integrating AI to streamline workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and boost operational efficiency.  
  - **Predictive Ride Matching**: Intelligent driver-passenger pairing using machine learning.  
  - **Real-time Data Insights**: Analyzing trip patterns for better service optimization.
